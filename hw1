mkdir ~/bioc6243 : this command creates a new file or directory

mkdir ~/bioc6243/project-linux : this creates a subsection within the directory

cd ~/bioc6243/project-linux : this moves into project directory

touch file.txt : this generates an empty file called file.txt

ls -ltr : lists file in current format

cp file.txt file_copy.txt : creates a copy of file.txt and stores as file_copy.txt

ls -ltr

rm /tmp/file.txt      : deletes file.txt
-r ~/mybioc6243       : deletes the file directory

cd ~/mybioc6243/project-linux     : changes the current working directory to the project folder

cp /groups/mybioc6243_0/data/fastq/toy.fastq .        : copy a fastq file into the project directory. The dot represents the current directory

ls -ltr

cat toy.fastq : prints the contents of toy.fastq to the terminal

less toy.fastq : opens file in scrollable view

head -20 toy.fastq : shows the first 20 entries. Editable

nano file.txt : opens file in nano text editor


tail -20 toy.fastq : shows the last 20 entries. editable as well.

cd ~/mybioc6243/project-linux : changes current directory to project-linux

grep "mistake" file.txt : highlights the word mistake in file.txt

grep "gene" file.txt : highlights the word gene in file.txt

echo "hello" > file.txt : Redirectes the word hello into file.txt and deletes exisitng content

echo "world" >> file.txt : appends the word world into file.txt without deleting exisiting content.

cat file.txt | grep "hello" cat shows the contents of file.txt, pipe transfers that output to the next command which is grep "hello". the output of this would only be hello; the other entries in the file are ignored

ls | grep ".txt" : lists files then the output is transferred to the next command which is grep. This means that only files ending with .txt are highlighted.

$ head -1000 /groups/bioc6243_0/data/gtf/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf > ./data/toy.gtf        extracts the first 1000 lines from a large annotation file

$ head -20 ./data/toy.gtf        views the first 20 entries

$ grep ^"1" ./data/toy.gtf        filters lines that start with 1

$ grep -v "^#" ./data/toy.gtf     -v grabs the lines that don't match the entry. Removes comment lines that begin with #.
